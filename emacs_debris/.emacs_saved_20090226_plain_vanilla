;; Added 2/26/2009
;; Helps integrate the info directories for the Cygwin stuff
;; into the existing framework?
;; I'm not entirely sure that this is the right thing to do, though:
;; ("c:/Program Files/emacs-22.3/info/" "c:/cygwin/usr/share/info/")
;; Therefore, I will try adding the directory for Cygwin's info-files
;; to the set of default paths that Emacs searches when building
;; its list of directories to use. I am not entirely sure that this
;; is the right thing to do, so I will have to be careful when fiddling
;; with this stuff from here on out.

;; Added 2/25/2009
;; to support Remember Mode.
; This is for Remember Mode integration with Org Mode:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "c:/Program Files/emacs-22.3/lisp/remember")
;; (require 'remember)
;; The following three sexp's may or may not be necessary.
;; The instructions said, "If you are, like me, missing the function
;; org-remember-insinuate, try the following." 
;;
;; Ah! Since M-x apropos tells me that I already have a function
;; called org-remember-insinuate, I guess I can omit the following
;; three sexp's from this initialization file for now.
;; (setq remember-annotation-functions '(org-remember-annotation))
;; (setq remember-handler-functions '(org-remember-handler))
;; (add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'org-remember-apply-template)
;; 
;; The following four expr's are from Section 9.1 of the Org Mode
;; documentation:
;; (org-remember-insinuate)
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")
;; (setq org-default-notes-file (concate org-directory "/notes.org"))
;; (define-key global-map "\C-cr" 'org-remember)

;; The Remember Mode setup instructions say the following three 
;; sexp's are needed in order to integrate with Planner Mode, which
;; I don't currently have set up...
;; (require 'remember-planner)
;; (setq remember-handler-functions '(remember-planner-append))
;; (setq remember-annotation-functions planner-annotation-functions)
;;
;; Added 2/24/2009:
;; Settings for org-mode:
;; The really lovely thing about all this is that it's possible to just
;; mark one of these expr's and then execute M-x eval-region!
;; 
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
;; (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
;; (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
; This activates the font-lock mode for the benefit of org mode?
;; (global-font-lock-mode 1)                     ; for all buffers
; Suggested by the David O'Toole tutorial:
;; (setq org-log-done 'note)
; This is for calendar/diary integration:
;; (setq org-agenda-include-diary nil)
