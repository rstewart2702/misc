** [2009-06-15 Mon 12:32] God's Will and Obedience
   I am all a-flush with rage again. Please help me, Lord God.  What
   matters is not the worldly standard of success, but whether or not I
   am submitting to you. My personal feelings, whether-or-not I like
   doing what you have called me to do, is quite immaterial. It seems
   that you may be calling me to do things I have NEVER wanted to do;
   I'm afraid that you will next demand that I do more of the things I
   hate to do.
   
   But that was the lie I believed, wasn't it, Lord: I believed the lie
   that you would primarily, most-of-the-time, call me to do things
   that I would enjoy doing, have me do things that I like to do. I
   don't want to be condemned to a lifetime of
   "money-management-for-the-kingdom": I HATE dealing with money,
   making decisions about the allocation and investing of money. Why do
   I hate it so, Lord God? Is it because I am scared of making
   mistakes, of screwing it up?  That is really a trust issue, isn't
   it? An issue of trusting in you...
   
   I don't understand why I have been given a love for this
   mathematical and logical stuff, and then I am given no opportunity
   to use it. Maybe it's an idol. If so, then it needs to die off. Why
   do I keep coming back to this place, Lord God?
** [2009-06-15 Mon 12:58] Talent, and God's Plans
   I'm pretty much convinced that all the sciences stuff, and all the math stuff,
   that I thought I liked, thought I was pretty good at, that God has enabled me
   to do, was a gift from Him...

   Heh: Maybe that's it. I'm using these abilities for myself instead of for Him?
   What's puzzling to me is that there doesn't seem to be any use for these skills
   other than for a "secular job." And the sole purpose of the secular job is to
   pull in money so that there'll be money to give to the things that truly matter
   to God's heart: missions, efforts to reach out to people who don't know Him,
   so that His name is glorified. Everything else is of little importance in
   comparison.

   HERE IS SOMETHING I WONDER ABOUT:
     Except for things which are about the start of life (birth), the
     preservation of life (medical sciences and infrastructure things like clean
     drinking water, sewage disposal, and housing?), and the end of life (like
     burial, funerals), there are not too many things that a person can do for a
     "secular job" which are all that important, or essential. What I must do for
     eight hours a day really does not matter very much. Or so it would seem to
     be.

   I have always looked at the job I would have in terms of something that would
   bring me satisfaction: I have always preferred to be able to do something
   that would be intellecutually challenging, yet have a profitability to it
   that would allow me to support my family. I have believed that this was just
   the way things are supposed to work, and that such an arrangement of things
   was God-ordained, since before the Fall of Man. Even before the fall, Adam
   had a job to do, right? And in the midst of that, he had a relationship with
   God himself, right there in Eden.

   What, oh God, is the connection between the secular job and the "reformation
   understanding" that even the most mundane work could be ordained, blessed,
   granted by you to somebody to complete. I had always thought that there was
   a way for the secular job to be glorifying to you, that you had redeemed ALL
   of it. And that the job of even the humble computer programmer could be
   something you have redeemed, ordained, set up, and that doing the job, in
   and of itself, was a good thing.

   Have I made the mistake of assigning it too much importance?
** [2009-06-15 Mon 13:51] Don't Understand How to Handle This Situation
   I don't understand how I am to handle this current situation,
   Lord. There is a saying: "Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It is a
   waste of your time, and it merely annoys the pig." I feel like
   trying to get my manager and coworkers to see the wisdom of
   correctly developing Oracle applications by set-oriented thinking
   might be like trying to teach a pig to sing.

   And I am SO reluctant to try to launch into my own attempt to
   re-engineer things on my own: I can only spend so much time on that
   without causing a problem (because a "private" project would have no
   management endorsement, permission to proceed.) I don't think it's
   right for me to have to spend my own time on such a thing, "outside"
   of the normal workday, just to prove a point they might not understand
   anyway! This is so frustrating; I am so very thankful to have a job
   provided by your hand, Lord, and I want things to be done well for
   my employer because I believe it is just the right thing to do by
   our customers. At the same time, my employer has institutionalized
   the very practices and habits which render the kinds of necessary
   improvements nearly impossible! Please help me to get past all this
   Renlar-related junk so that I can go back to improving the wretched
   rest of the situation! Or please provide me with the wherewithal to
   handle this situation with the kind of grace and aplomb that will
   glorify your name. I know this isn't about me and what I would like
   to do, and this is not about how I can show just how unbelievably
   brilliant I am. I am guilty of so much pride in my professional
   life and I need to repent of that. Please forgive me, Lord God.
** [2009-06-15 Mon 15:43] For What Am I Responsible?
   I was not prepared (as as prepared as I should have been) to share
   the Gospel with that drug-addicted lady (Alfredo's mother) and her
   "friend." But does it follow that God was somehow impaired from
   moving in their lives? Help me to understand, Lord.

   I rebelled against the youth guy at FBC Albuquerque, and I wanted to
   have nothing to do with him, when I saw that workbook with the
   quotation from Ezekiel on the cover, about how the blood of the lost
   would be on my hands because I failed to share. That book made me
   angry. It still haunts me today. Oh God, please help me to know the
   truth about the whole thing, and to leave the past behind, and push
   ahead to what I know to be true now.

   That experience, and examination of other parts of my life, have
   forced me to consider my salvation, my standing before almighty
   God. It's like I have known the truth about some things, and have
   refused to comply: that is disobedience at the best, and at the
   worst is the mindset and heart-state of a God-less pretender who
   is fooling himself and others. I am forced to confront this
   question.

   I know that, at the very least, I have been a profound
   disappointment to my family and my wife, who wants me to lead and
   get the right things into motion.
** [2009-06-15 Mon 17:21] Never Heard from the Old Job
   Nobody ever emailed me from the AT&T problem management bunch. Sad.
   I did hear, a couple of times, from folks who had worked in the
   performance metrics area. Ah, well. This was really sad, eh? In our
   cold-culture world, people are what they do, and what they can do
   for you. In other words, the only reason there's contact between
   people is because they need someone to do something for them. This
   is a pity, isn't it?
** [2009-06-16 Tue 08:25] Obedience
   My obedience before God must be immediate, unconditional. It has
   been neither: it has been delayed, conditional. And I shall have to
   live with the consequences. Don't know what else to say right now,
   but I do know that I have been caught up, continually, in all kinds
   of things which don't matter...
** [2009-06-22 Mon 08:57] I'm Reeling...
   Lord God, I'm reeling; please help me this morning to quit feeling
   so overwhelmed by life, because I consistently try to push it back
   by acting out in various ways which don't honor you.

   I know that I have been disobedient to you; please help me to start
   to obey you in all things, starting with this morning.
** [2009-06-24 Wed 14:42] Thoughts on Purpose at Work
   Got into brief chat w/Angelia before leaving for work this morning
   regarding the purposes God might have for a person in the workplace.
   Had remarked about the frustration with having to wait for others to
   complete a task before one can re-start one's work, and the often
   observed lack of urgency in the work habits of others...

   Heh: I have sometimes shown a lack of urgency myself, right?

   My other beef is that I have seen managers complain bitterly, and
   chide their employees, over things which the employees can't
   control. My basic statement is: "Don't you dare, Mr. Manager, come
   to me and start to gripe about how long something took to complete
   when so much of the delay was due to factors over which I have no
   control, and which are in place in the organization at your demand!
   Things are the way they are because of your demands and
   restrictions.  So don't come griping to me when I can't finish the
   job you want me to do on time because of delays caused by others
   trying to follow instructions for which you are responsible.  I have
   no patience and no respect for someone who sets up an organization
   which causes the very problems you have the temerity to complain
   about!"

   But that is just so much silliness, right? Human organizations are
   fallen, flawed. And it's quite obvious in intellect-oriented
   activities like computer programming.

   I had also remarked about how things have to be packaged up
   perfectly, and in perfect working order, before they get deployed
   into the production environment, or you end up with a mess which is
   (nearly) impossible to clean up quickly, because there is no
   flexibility left in a production environment. I complained bitterly
   about the laziness that comes into play when people package things
   up, and don't bother to make it simple, documented, because they are
   ruled by the "just throw something out there, we'll fix it in place
   if it breaks, later, okay?" attitude. There is a twin evil, which
   leads to that evil: the laziness which leads to overly complex designs
   which make it even harder to create "deployments" which will work.
   It's one of those "the more you can get right up front, the better"
   kinds of things.

   And Angelia reminded me that as a Christ-follower, I can't expect
   the mind of a Christ-follower from other people who probably aren't
   Christ-followers as a rule. She hearkened to the example of Daniel,
   who had to be radical and different in how he lived his life, how he
   decided to do everything, and it got hime noticed, for sure, but it
   came at a cost to him, and to those around him (vide
   Shadrach/Hananiah, Meschach/Azariah, and Abed-nego/Mishael, his
   compatriots!)

   So what I have to do is decide whether or not God wants me to really
   push hard on this programming work, and push hard to present a "more
   excellent way" to my colleagues that will make them sit up and
   listen.  I have felt that if there is going to be a change, it will
   come via somebody teaching and showing a better way to do
   things. The question which remains is whether or not God is calling
   me to, in particular, work extra hard to come up with rewritten,
   redesigned version of the PL/SQL code in our systems which is deeply
   flawed and problematic. Also, is it God's will for me to spend the
   dozens of extra hours ("unpaid" hours?) to design the superior
   implementations, and explain them to my colleagues, so that lasting
   improvements can be put into place.
** [2009-06-26 Fri 09:08] Morning thoughts
   It's all a mulligan stew in my head this morning. Why, Lord, did I
   feel compelled to go spend about two hours with those guys, who
   clearly aren't interested in the leadership of our pastor? It's all
   such an ungodly mess, in a way. Why is it that I don't think of all
   the things to say that Angelia thinks of? Why can't I see the cherry
   picking and call it what it is? I guess that part of the issue is
   that I feel that I have to put in my dues, each week, to help keep
   me on God's good side, if I am honest about it.

   Plus, I have to scurry back to the house in about an hour and a
   half. No stress there, eh?

   Why do I leave things until the last possible moment before the
   deadline? Why aren't the things which are important to me also
   important to others? Because I am selfish, and so are they, right?

   Oh, Lord God, please help me to love my wife. What's really got me
   shaken to the core is that I woke up, I don't know when, hearing her
   say "computer," or "You on the computer," as if she was asking me...
   I know that I have been an issue before, and I absolutely hate that
   she feels so insecure about that, and I hate that I have given her
   reason to feel that way in the first place. Oh, Lord God, what is my
   problem this morning?

   I have put off: sending in those two 1040X's, paying bills that need
   to be paid, sending in that car accident report form to the state. I
   have put off doing things for our anniversary, I have put off doing
   what needs to be done so that we know what it takes for use to live
   and so that we can be in a position to give away the rest. Please
   help me to attack that list of "stuff that needs to be done." I have
   shown over and over that I am constitutionally in capable of
   sustaining that, on my own power, over a long period of time (say, a
   lifetime?) I don't know what to do about this, I don't understand
   why I don't want to do the things that are necessary. Why do I fight
   with this so much?  Am I really, truly a Christ follower? I'm
   wondering if I am when I struggle so much with such issues.

   To be honest, one of the things that was so appealing about living
   in a place like Guatemala is that the worries about such issues, the
   stuff that we all have to deal with, won't be such a big concern. It
   seems like such a magical kind of time and place to be, when you can
   just serve, seek God's face each morning, and then go and be the
   body of Christ together... And yes, like Rian mentioned last night,
   one can hide behind "acts of service to God" in an effort to run
   away from the real problems, issues. And yes, one of the appealing
   things about "being together with the body, serving together," is
   that all this other stuff doesn't have the hold over you any longer,
   but the life at home does seem to have that hold over you. The stuff
   that men (and women) struggle with, the materialism, and the efforts
   to self-medicate because of the (often self-imposed) misery that
   arises, do not seem to be as much of an issue, because you're
   focused on service to Jesus, the service to others, the service to
   the body of Christ.

   One of the points I tried to make: I am not excused from trying to
   deal with these questions of materialism, doing something about it,
   just because there's a risk that I will turn it into another attempt
   to please God with my works, or self-medicate with acts of service.
   Blackaby's book tries to address that issue, when he mentions that
   God is far more interested in a relationship with you than He is in
   what you can do for Him. And He is interested in your obedience to
   Him, before you start trying to do stuff for Him. But I don't think
   those guys get that, Lord, and I have tried to communicate that to
   them. But it seems that they're so non-plussed by what has been
   taught at our church (and thus they're non-plussed by the Gospel?)
   and so jaded by what they have seen in the past, that they are
   closed off to the notion that God is so powerful and able to work in
   people's lives that this time, all the stuff that David Platt's been
   preaching about might just be for real in people's lives. And it
   just might be the case that this time, because God is faithful and
   powerful and will work out His will, that maybe people will start
   realistically confronting the stuff they struggle with, and the
   "sins which so easily ensnare us," and God will get the glory
   because He is big enough to deal with all the junk that sullies our
   lives and turn us into participants in His huge, God-sized adventure
   (and fight, even) to bring the Gospel to all nations, and reconcile
   all people to Himself.

   Perhaps part of the "life" that Ken Bush is so passionate about is
   (i) not, primarily, about making you personally happy or satisfied
   (this is a by-product, a consequence, and NOT the reason for obeying
   in the first place, right?)  (ii) the great adventure, and battle,
   of following after Jesus Christ, being the church body before the
   world so that people in the surrounding culture really sit up and
   take notice.

   So, on of the primary issues is that we face so much, and feel so
   alone, because we get up in the morning and launch straight into the
   day without spending a time period on our knees before God Himself,
   seeking his face and heart and asking for the strength to deal with
   the day and with what life is confronting us with. We need, I need to
   routinely sek his sovereignty and overarching grace and guidance. I
   would like to think, anyway, that there would be fewer problems with
   trying to self-medicate, etc, if I (and all men) would do that sort
   of thing first thing, each day.

   God is greater than all these things, even the stuff that Daniel K
   is dealing with, fighting with, in his life.
** [2009-06-26 Fri 10:19] Struggling
   I don't like this Renlar stuff, Lord God. Please help me to submit
   to you and have the right attitude about it. Help me to be faithful
   to you, your name, in this matter. I'm really struggling with this,
   and I guess it's really because I'm a rebellious person who doesn't
   want to submit to authority, and who wants to do his own thing, all
   the time. And this doesn't glorify your name, does it?
** [2009-06-26 Fri 10:28] Angry-angry-angry
   I'm furious that I have to leave now, Lord. Please help me to do
   what's right here, and not sin about this. I am struggling with
   feeling paranoid about all this, having to leave after only being
   here about 1.5 hours. Especially with Venki being out-of-office
   right now (he had to be up in the middle of the night...)
** [2009-06-29 Mon 10:44] Emacs and Subversion, Finding Diff's
   Okay, here's how to use Emacs and svn together to compare entire
   source trees. It is useful to use Emacs as a sophisticated wrapper
   around svn commands, because Emacs can process the output of svn
   commands like
     svn diff -r BASE:HEAD file_of_source_code.sql
   or
     svn diff -r BASE:HEAD path-to-directory-of-source-code-files
   (when we want to see a comparison of an entire directory's worth of
   source code files.)

   In svn's parlance, BASE stands for "the revision number of the file
   or directory in local storage" and HEAD stands for "the latest
   revision number of what's in the repository."

   Now, I had spent a lot of time in confusion about what BASE and HEAD
   mean when I was using svn at the command-line, and became quite
   frustrated when I couldn't get Emacs to duplicate what I had been
   able to get at the command line by running:
     svn diff -r HEAD file_of_source_code
   and apparently, such a command is equivalent to:
     svn diff -r BASE:HEAD file_of_source_code

   The confusing thing is that the generalized Emacs wrapper around svn
   was designed to use two explicit revision numbers when it tries to
   execute an "svn diff" command, and I didn't understand that until a
   few weeks ago.

   So, to run the same things within Emacs that we'd otherwise run from
   the command line, we can use "C-u 1 C-x v =" and then give the path
   to the directory or filename we wish to compare against the
   repository. Then enter "BASE" for the older revision number (which
   stands for the local store's version of the file or directory) and
   enter "HEAD" for the newer revision number (which stands for the
   latest version which is in the repository.)

   This only makes sense, of course, when one expects one's local store
   to be older than what is in the repository (which is where I am
   working from much of the time these days.) If I was trying to
   compare my recently changed and updated local version against the
   (presumably outdated) latest version in the repository, then I would
   enter HEAD as the "older" revision number, and BASE into the "newer"
   revision number.
** [2009-06-30 Tue 08:31] No wretched way...
   ...that I'm going to any of that Tuesday night stuff. But the whole
   "Are you being real?" thing is really a smokescreen, or can be. What
   is so perplexing is that: (i) the "conventional church" has not
   dealt with this effectively; (ii) this leads to splinter movements
   which make other kinds of errors, and which may fail to effectively
   deal with these kinds of questions as well; (iii) nobody in that
   bunch is willing to really pitch in and participate in the immense,
   God-sized task of really building, helping to foster, truly Biblical
   community in which the people of God really do work together,
   counsel each other, live the life together as the body of Christ,
   and deal with sin in a truly Biblical, redemptive manner which
   honors Christ, takes God's holiness seriously, and which leads to
   real, lasting, world-impacting change. David Platt is genuinely
   trying to pull us into that place, or push us there. However, it is
   the hardest, and in the end, the only Biblical thing to do, though.
   As C. S. Lewis put it, "The longest way round is the shortest way
   home." Any other way is a kind of fatal compromise that Jesus
   repeatedly warned us we could not engage in.

   I think men want to stay in their place of "dealing with their own
   particular issues" instead of getting through that so that they can
   get on to the serious business of being the Body of Christ? There
   seems to be a propensity to "sit and stew" because men have been
   "mistreated by the church and the surrounding culture." Arguably,
   the "church" has not really been the true Body of Christ, and has
   really become part of the surrounding culture, and that is why it
   has failed to be the ministry, sustenance to people who're trying
   to follow Jesus: it has failed to be the true Body of Christ?

   Maybe the junk that men (and women) deal with would not be as much
   of an issue in their lives if they would set aside their
   materialistic, westernized, post-modern worldview and really follow
   Jesus Christ, with radical abandon? I'm feeling strongly that there
   is some substance, some genuine hardness, dependability,
   foundational truth to such an argument. If you're too absorbed in
   following Jesus, in truly being a part of the Body of Christ, then
   all that other junk ("the deceitfulness of riches, the worries of
   this world, and the desires for other things," Jesus called them)
   simply will not matter any more. Perhaps part of the job of the
   Christ-follower is to relentlessly remove that kind of stuff from
   his or her life, with the help of others in the Body, and the Holy
   Spirit. We can't radically abandon this world and all it offers to
   us, and follow after Jesus, unless He is dwelling in us first, and
   we daily take up our cross and follow after Him, living in
   community with other Christ followers who are committed to the same
   life, within the framework of a local church body. 
** [2009-07-01 Wed 13:44] So tired of...
   ...foolishness manifested in the utter lack of understanding on the
   part of the people who worked on this stuff. They didn't do
   themselves or their employer any favors at all. I wonder if McKesson
   management was penny-wise and pound-foolish, by refusing to expect,
   and hire, Oracle competence. We're really being forced to live with
   it now, aren't we? No telling how much business it has cost us.
   Clientele like Publix may just go with a different vendor the next
   time they have to make a switch, just because they have had such a
   horrendous experience with the data conversion software working so
   unreliably. And Spartan sees some of the same kinds of nonsense,
   right?

   Maker and ruler of the universe, please help me to understand and
   know you, and understand what you want me to be in this job. I'm
   struggling mightily with this right now.
** [2009-07-01 Wed 15:19] Prayer for Suzy
   Oh, Lord God, please gird up Suzy today: grant her the strength to
   get through today, and to do what's right. Please grant her position
   grace, favor before the judge, in this upcoming hearing. Please
   bring the kids back to Birmingham, Lord God. I pray for Ron's
   salvation, and for the kids to be brought back to Bham, before the
   end of the summer. God, I pray for resources (spiritual, financial)
   for Suzy and her kids, and that this would be ended soon so that
   they can get onto the next part of life. Please grant Suzy clarity
   of mind, and favor before the doctor she goes to see; please grant
   her and Uncle Jay clarity of thought and mind, so that there won't
   be these painful fights/struggles/arm-wrestling matches, over money.

   God, you bring us to places where we need to trust in you, where
   things simply won't work any other way. Mighty, Holy One: you are
   great and sovereign, and will do what is best. Help me to trust in
   you instead of my own understanding, my own efforts to do what seems
   right to me, what seems pleasing to me. I pray for favor here at the
   office, and opportunities to show what I can do... Is there any way,
   Lord God? Should I even be concerned about such things? How do I
   balance "excellence at the job" with "what glorifies your name"? Is
   work merely to provide money, or is there a way for people to see
   your glory through what you have enabled me to do, see?
** [2009-07-02 Thu 15:21] A Prayer
   Oh, Lord God, please be with Suzy and Uncle Jay today. Please grant
   Suzy the perspective and insight to go ahead and get a job. Please
   help her to find one. Please help Uncle Jay to calm down, and to
   find a job as well.

   Please help Suzy to get the medical care she needs and to get the
   money she needs. Oh, Lord God, she is a single mother... Oh, You
   already know all that.

   Please touch my ailing carcass. Why do our bodies do these things?
** [2009-07-07 Tue 09:04] Morning thoughts
   Last week, and some over the "long weekend," had listened to some of
   the Covenant Community sermon series. Lots to chew on, just in the
   texts quoted from the letter to the Hebrews. All that about leaving
   behind the sin and things which so easily ensnare us is apropos. And
   the bits about "holding fast" to: "our confession" (Heb. 4:14), "the
   hope set before us" (Heb. 7:18)

   Oh, how I need to change, be changed, and oh, how I resist it. And I
   know this is becoming an issue, will become an issue, with my poor
   wife: I'm not leading as I ought to be.

   I am way too concerned about my own intellectual standing, and how
   people perceive my intelligence and "smarts." It does me absolutely
   no good to be called "our smart friend."  Surely this is part of
   what the Eldredgians speak of when they use that word "poser." (The
   insufferable part is that anybody who doesn't agree with everything
   they say must therefore be a "poser," even when there are legitimate
   objections raised to the mis-handling of scripture, eh? My
   self-doubt in the whole discussion is because I allow that talk of
   how "every man is a 'poser' and must stop being such" to distract me
   from trying to present the truth. I know that I present a certain
   face to the world around me and don't want to be thought of less
   highly than I am currently. Good grief! Doesn't everyone do that?
   Just because somebody has had a past problem/issue, doesn't mean
   that he is still a miserable "poser," does it? Maybe part of the
   issue is that everybody is a "poser," and can also be a presenter of
   the truth?)

   Oh, something that occurred to me on last Friday afternoon: perhaps
   the doing of the things mentioned in Romans 12 (even just the
   attempt to live that way) is part of being transformed? I think that
   is what my acquaintances have missed, misunderstood, or don't want
   to understand (because of their obsession with other things?) Yes,
   people struggle with their sinful ways, but perhaps part of working
   that out is to engage in behaviors and actions which make the sinful
   behaviors less likely, less accessible, less of an issue? Isn't that
   part of "holding fast to the hope set before us," and the "leaving
   behind of the sin which so easily ensnares us?" The "solution" (if
   that's the right way to speak of it) is certainly not to be found in
   this endless meetings of people who have decided that the "present
   organization of the church" is not for them, because of past
   mistakes, slights (real or perceived.) You don't get a free pass to
   ignore Biblical authority and teaching on the proper role of the
   church body, and your place in it, just because the church
   leadership has become focused on evangelism at the expense of some
   non-biblical standard of pastoral care. I don't care how "real" men
   are being with each other when they decide that Bibilical authority
   is not for them. This "encounter of men with other men" seems to be
   about becoming self-focused instead of God-focused, Christ-focused,
   gospel-focused, and it is wrong.
** [2009-07-07 Tue 10:02] This is so useful
   Emacs with Org mode and Remember mode is so incredibly useful. I
   don't know how I got along without it. I thank you, Lord God, for
   providing it: it is from your hand.

   Might this sort of software be the kind of thing which is how you
   want men to use their abilities, to further the capabilities of men
   to serve you and "create value?"

   Could I create something which would be useful to a pastor's
   maintenance of his blog, and other literature which he writes? How
   might I be able to contribute to that? Are you even calling me to
   that? Is this something which I should even be troubling myself
   with? Am I just cramming your will into my mold? Please help me to
   know, Lord God, what your will is regarding this.
** [2009-07-07 Tue 13:59] Prayer for JT
   Just got word from Sheryl Turner that JT is at doc's office: they've
   been running tests, and apparently aren't happy with what they're
   seeing. Oh, Lord God: why is this happening to JT? What in the world
   is happening to his health, Lord? Please touch him, touch
   Sheryl. Please forgive me for my heart-attitude, my mindset; please
   hear our prayers for JT...

   You desire a love relationship with me. So then, why don't I desire
   a growing, increasing love relationship with you? I have a love and
   trust problem, and hence have an obedience problem?
** [2009-07-08 Wed 08:48] Why am I this way?
   Feeling desperation: need to get a credit card payment shipped off
   (BofA card we used in GT, small amount, $50 total, maybe...)  Why do
   I feel desperate this way? My behavior is inexplicable to me. I am a
   41 year old man, who can't get his act together. What is my
   problem?

   These feelings are typical of a person who is irresponsible. And
   it's not my wife's fault, either. Lord God, I feel so far from you
   right now; why?
** [2009-07-11 Sat 12:15] Why this struggle?
   Working through unit 12 in Blackaby: day 5 talks about the
   "marketplace." Blackaby says that "I believe one reason Jesus called
   businesspeople is that they are not intimidated by the world."
   (p. 262)

   Later, on page 262:
     Why was so much of God's activity accomplished in the marketplace?
     Because that is where people lived throughout the week. The same
     is true for believers today. Church on Sunday provides an
     opportunity for the saints to be equipped for their mission work
     throughout the week at their job sites...

     One of the greatest movements of God I am seeing today is His work
     in the marketplace. I work with a group of Christian CEOs of some
     of America's largest companies. *These men and women have realized
     God has placed them in their positions for a purpose.*...

     Many people are discovering that God has placed them in their
     companies so they can be witnesses to their colleagues as well as
     to customers.

   One of the things I am struggling with, *hugely*, is whether or not
   I have worked in computing just because that is what *I* liked to
   do, and used it as an escape, or a way to get approval that did not
   require so much interaction, dealing with people. (That was my
   mindset at the beginning, anyway...) I really wonder if this is
   where I should be at all, because of the sheer futility of it all,
   and because of my tendency to please myself instead of seeking hard
   after God *first*.

   I am being forced to question whether or not I have been wasting my
   life, and have been focused on doing what *I like to do*, instead
   of what God wants. Lord, your word says that when I line myself up
   with you and what you want, then one side-effect will be joy and
   contentment. Please forgive me for placing my contentment and
   satisfaction above your heart and your will: I fear I have done
   that. Please "maintain the pressure," line up my family around me
   so that we can follow you, your heart, your purposes, your ways,
   *together*, so that Your name is glorified, so that people around
   us see and hear You in the midst of what is happening in our lives,
   and follow you. (Why am I not thinking about such things daily? Why
   am I not getting up in the morning, thinking about what God wants
   to do through me?)

   Oh, Lord God! Please help me to set aside the deceitfulness of
   riches, the worries of this world, and the desires for other
   things! 
** [2009-07-13 Mon 09:16] A call yesterday...
   Got a call from Paul Shellum yesterday: Bill Grant, consultant who
   had worked with the group I used to work for at BellSouth (before it
   became AT&T), died in a go-cart-racing accident. Purely random
   thing, really: he broke his neck when the braking mechanisms on his
   home-built go-cart failed and he lost control of the vehicle.

   I need to use this opportunity to share the Gospel, Lord, with all
   involved; I just don't know how to say it without
   sounding... Heh. "Sounding like what?" What's that supposed to mean?
   The Gospel message is intrinsically offensive to many who don't
   believe that there is such a thing as sin, and therefore don't see
   the need for redemption, right? But I don't get a free pass to sweep
   the issue under the rug just because people who are lost without you
   might be offended, eh?
** [2009-07-13 Mon 09:35] Prayer this morning
   Dear God: help me to work out what it means to get these things
   done, to be a competent worker...

   Please grant the doc's wisdom in Suzy's case, and please grant her
   favor in their sight so that she doesn't get proud and refuse to
   admit that she needs a financial break from them, if at all
   possible. Please grant her favor with the doc's and their
   bookkeepers. Please help Uncle Jay to trust you.

   God, I don't know how to pray for JT and Sheryl, except to say that
   I love them, want them to be "okay"... Please grant them your mercy,
   peace; they need your refreshment, replenishment, encouragement. The
   very human side of me wants, as Angelia said, to tell JT that he's
   living out the consequences of refusing to take better care of his
   body, etc, etc. I don't know how to deal with that, right? There's
   that predominant part of me which just wants everything to be okay,
   wants to avoid conflict, confrontation. Yet that is what you do with
   each of us, right? Show us the ulgly truth of things, and then
   redeem us from it, from death and sin and hell, anyway. The older I
   get, the more I realize that all of life is completely unmanageable
   apart from complete and total surrender to you, Lord, to be the one
   "running the show."

   Please grant JT grace so that he doesn't have to leave us just
   yet. Please, Lord God.

   It's all so hard: I can't do any of it unless you are working
   through me. You provide it all, every thing I know how to do came
   as your gift and provision. I think I can sometimes understand why
   you want me to participate, and yet I often don't get it, Lord. I
   know you understand me better than I do...
** [2009-07-15 Wed 10:14] JUST NEED TO VENT
   Y'know, it's just too bloody bad that the conversion code is so
   badly written, isn't it? "We need to find out what happened." Good
   grief. I don't understand these jerks. They push on people, and
   these mere people crank out garbage. Then, after all their pushing
   and pressuring of their mere people, they have the gall to complain
   about the quality of the final product. I am really struggling here,
   Lord God. But I should have just resigned myself to this sort of
   nonsense when I took this job, because every place has its problems,
   and this kind of problem exists in all kinds of organizations.

   I wonder if this stuff was written when Stanton McComb was running
   the show? Or does the horror that is the dataloader package pre-date
   his watch?

   Either way, none of the folks who were in charge when dataloader was
   being written will want to admit just what a dog it is, and perhaps
   that is part of the problem. Admitting that it really is an
   unmanageable dog would also mean admitting that they didn't do a
   good job getting it built in the first place; it would be an
   admission of failure. So, the system is stacked against making
   improvements that would prevent the kind of junk we're seeing
   now. This is a huge, ongoing problem, and it won't get better unless
   the system allows people to admit their failures without getting cut
   off at the knees.
** [2009-07-15 Wed 11:11] VENTING SOME MORE
   I'm quite tired of this stuff; BSelle confirmed that McComb's watch
   started after the dataloader code had been in production for a
   couple of years. So, this lends credence to my thesis that nobody
   wants to step up and point out that "the emperor has no clothes,"
   i.e., that the dataloader code base stinks to high heaven, that it
   was poorly conceived, written badly, and is costing us huge time,
   money, and customer good-will.
** [2009-07-15 Wed 12:17] VENT SOME MORE
   This was/is all avoidable. I don't understand this silliness...
** [2009-07-16 Thu 08:21] Spend a Pile of Time on Fixing Something at Work? HAH!
   Angelia and I got in this somewhat lengthy talk (in the car, on the
   way to the Turners' house) about whether or not it's God's will for
   me to put in a bunch of time working on a proof-of-concept of
   something that will decisively demonstrate the superiority of the
   declarative approach (that's not what I called it to her, but that
   is what I was talking about...) I said that such an effort means
   lots of 12-hour days. Her reply was, "If that is what you feel like
   the Lord is leading you to do, then do it."

   The problem is, I don't hear God saying that I should do such a
   thing. My human thinking says, "Don't bother, they won't understand
   or appreciate what it means anyway, so there is not a compelling
   reason to do it." I'm really struggling hugely, here, Lord God. Such
   an effort won't ever get management endorsement:
       (i) Management doubts the necessity of the changes I would propose.
      (ii) They won't see the necessity because they haven't received
           a convincing demonstration of the necessity.
     (iii) It will take tremendous effort to demonstrate the necessity.
      (iv) This effort will not be approved because the necessity
           has not been demonstrated.
   
   I don't think it's worth launching into an "independent effort" on
   my own initiative, unless there will be a payoff, unless it will
   help foment change in the way we do things. And I am not convinced
   that the cost to me personally (in terms of flak I will get from my
   wife for being away, distracted, etc, and the time it will take me
   away from my family) will be justified by the potential
   benefit. McKesson management doesn't appear to care one way or the
   other, and the sad thing is that it may very well take a competitor
   who does it the right way to show them that their approach is way
   too costly. And by that point, hopefully McKesson will still be in
   the game enough to make a correction and stay competitive.

   So, Lord, do you want me to work on such a thing? What is the
   purpose for my being here? I thought that I would get to do
   something like this (this "proving the superiority of a declarative
   approach") by coming to McKesson, but it turns out that I was
   dreaming, not living in reality. What should I do? I have not
   received the go-ahead from you on something like this. So, I haven't
   really pressed the matter.

   I am angry this morning, angry about this, and the fact that I have
   to stop, just as I have hit my stride.

   I need your help, Lord God, to get it done today. Angelia angrily
   said, "I hope you get everything done today that you need to get
   done." I have a feeling she didn't really care one way or the
   other. Forgive me for making my wife angry this morning, and for
   making her angry by failing to lead, to make an effort for her and
   the girls. I am failing right now, and I won't succeed unless you
   work through me: I don't have it in me to do these things. Partly
   because I don't want to, don't have the desire to, and partly
   because I don't have the ability to do so, I guess. You know better
   than I do, Lord God...

** [2009-07-16 Thu 11:19] An answered prayer
  CG seemed to be asking, this morning after the AR/LTC meeting, what
  it might take to demonstrate the benefits of the declarative
  approach (my words, not his...)

  In so many words, he confirmed that: we're indeed facing the
  conundrum that management won't endorse efforts that it thinks are
  of dubious necessity, and we can't prove that there is necessity
  unless we do some work that management won't approve of because they
  can't see the necessity! Obviously, there's a vicious cycle here.

  CG felt that part of the path out of the vicious cycle is to try to
  build a prototype, starting with the "simplest domain area,"
  prescribers perhaps. Such an approach has its own risks, such as
  oversimplification and incorrectly extrapolating from the simpler
  experience to derive estimates of what it will take to handle the
  more complicated areas: my experience is that management rarely
  understands such risks, and only hears the rosy estimates based on
  the (very limited) experience with the simpler area. And then when
  it comes time to tackle the complicated area later, there are all
  kinds of problems and credibility with management suffers because
  they didn't hear all the caveats you stated, only the rosy
  estimates. But it probably takes longer to try and deal with the
  more complicated domain area and prototype what it might take to
  substantially improve that, so what can one do if the goal is to get
  management's sign-off to initiate work that they haven't felt was
  necessary in the first place?

  He (CG, that is) showed me figures which seemed to imply that as
  many as 10 concurrent loads (of base datasets?) can finish in about
  8.75 hours, whereas the same loads, run serially, take about 33
  hours to complete. Assuming those numbers are indeed correct,
  reasonable, realistic, etc, then all of the "deck-chair rearranging"
  KR's been doing with his performance testing and tweaking for
  Safeway has resulted in something that is "good enough." At least,
  good enough to get Safeway to proceed. And Safeway is putatively the
  largest kind of customer we're ever likely to need to help, so if
  the present regime is good enough for them, it should be good enough
  for just about anybody, right?

  My suspicion is that it won't be good enough for very long. I have
  seen nothing to confirm to me that we have done anything more than
  throw a band-aid on the situation in order to get Safeway's
  business, and there is very little in place to keep something else
  from blowing up in our faces with Safeway at some later point. This
  is a direct consequence of the mess that the dataloader code is. I
  don't see how the present design (and I use that term pretty
  loosely) of the dataloader is sustainable, comprehensible, and how
  it can be maintained for reasonable expense. The present dataloader
  code is just a big mess, and anybody who has some nontrivial
  experience with Oracle applications would be able to see
  that. Unfortunately, before I came along, nobody in this
  organization could see that fact, or they just thought that the
  status quo was the only way things could possibly be, because they
  didn't know any better. The lack of Oracle experience across the
  board meant that nobody had an inkling of how it could be better.

  It is equally clear that management won't consider changing the
  status quo until we can provide them with a compelling reason to do
  so, thus leading us to start that chicken-or-egg cycle I mentioned
  earlier. They can't see that declarative approaches are far
  superior, and I suspect that this is a common problem across the
  industrialized world.

  This at least confirms what I had suspected. And this is an answer
  to prayer! Thank you, Lord God! You are indeed at work in the world
  around me, even in things as mundane and eternally insignificant as
  this!

  So, Lord, what is the answer to the question of whether or not I
  should try to push "on my own time," to see how to prototype a
  proof-of-concept of the something like PRESCRIBER or RX (which I
  have already done a considerable amount of poking into?)

  'Nuff said for now...
** [2009-07-17 Fri 09:33] Why?
   Why is it so hard, Lord God? Why is it that life just works out this
   way? Help me to understand why I'm so frustrated and angry with
   things like this. Help me to get through this day. I am so far
   away. It's like I know that You are real, yet I did not, do not,
   obey, follow-through, etc. And all of the rest of life around me
   does not stop and wait. And I feel angry and frustrated because when
   I try to push, lead, spouse gets angry with me, says I am pushing
   too hard, etc. I don't understand: when I do try to "lead, make it
   happen," I get pounded into dust.

   Maybe if she saw me leading by example, if she saw me getting up
   early in the morning and turning to you, then she would more
   willingly follow my lead.
** [2009-07-17 Fri 16:38] Hah!
   Listening to CG, KR, ruminating, scratching heads, over some bunch
   of loading runs they're doing for Safeway's benefit, I guess.

   It makes me sad: the blind leading the blind, eh?

   Heh: I'll bet this is the kind of thing that CG really doesn't enjoy
   anyway, and he certainly isn't much good at it himself. (Reminds me
   of other bosses I have had in the past...)

   What will it take for me to give him a "warm fuzzy" so that he will
   trust me enough to allow me to do things that play to my strengths?
   This is the nauseating paradox of it all: I'm being assigned
   low-priority, low-risk items, obviously. And he's just waiting to
   see how it turns out? Perhaps he has no idea what I am capable of,
   and thought strictly in terms of "hiring an Oracle expert" so that
   he could say, "Yep, I've got one of those on staff, yes siree!"

   I'm just struggling to understand...
** [2009-07-21 Tue 11:48] Trust, and who is asked to do what...
   Heh: CG asks KR to do stuff he wouldn't ask me to do, and stuff that
   I could arguably do a much better job on. I guess when you're stuck
   in "survival mode" you go with the "tried and true," instead of
   taking risks? They hired me to bring in Oracle expertise, and then
   don't ask me about certain things? Well: none of what I'm really
   good at comes into play when you're trying to just maintain the
   status quo. An existing code base that is a huge liability, a huge
   problem, is not a good thing to have to live with, but that is the
   way they have decided to do things, I guess. Hah.

   I guess CG, et al, thought that getting somebody with Oracle
   expertise would help the existing situation, without the need to
   rewrite large swaths of code. But I have tried, as diplomatically as
   possible, to point out that such thinking was incorrect: you can't
   make this situation better without rewriting the dataloader. This is
   not a risk, an approach, they appear ready to take on. Too bad,
   their loss.

   Lord God, is there a way I could take on something like "improving
   the RX processing," kind of "on my own," just to prove the point? Do
   I need to do that in order to glorify your name? Or would it be a
   colossal waste of time? It makes me sad. Funny that such a situation
   should deeply sadden me: it means that my fragile ego is involved,
   and it should not be a part of the picture, should it? Maybe the
   reason it so saddens and frustrates me is becase I feel I'm being
   deprived of a chance to show how smart I am, how good I am at this
   stuff. I think that is correct, and I am way too heavily invested in
   stuff that makes me feel good, wanted, proud, etc. Good grief.

   Help me to answer this question Lord: is it worth it to try to
   cobble together my own proof-of-concept, "on my own time," so to
   speak?
** [2009-07-22 Wed 07:56] Why Can't I help?
   Why couldn't I help with the "user interface" that Bron would
   apparently build to manage the data_map_item information?

   And ah, I remember why I'm being employed in this manner: CG had
   remarked about having to "do more with less" and make sure that
   everybody on his staff is generally familiar with the whole grand
   range of things. (Perhaps that range is too large, but that's
   another discussion for another time, eh? Perhaps he would agree with
   such an assessment, but is unable to do much about it at any
   rate...) It seems that I must become something of a generalist, but
   they're also forgetting the benefits of some Oracle specialization,
   too.

   My point is that everybody's forgetting about the benefits of using
   Oracle effectively: so many of the problems they're having boil down
   to the database being used ineffectively in the first place! So,
   guess what? We've ended up spending a huge amount of time on trying
   to address problems that arose because of ignorance about hot to use
   Oracle effectively in the first place! The organization is being
   forced into some kind of Oracle competence now, isn't it, whether
   that is what anybody wanted or not, right? The other unfortunate
   thing is that it's mainly just "superficial" changes, not deep
   improvements: the changes are merely "tweaks" which will not
   fundamentally improve the fact that the entire thing is too brittle
   to stand up to future demands...
** [2009-07-23 Thu 10:20] Oh, Overwhelmed!
   Oh, Lord, feeling overwhelmed this morning! Please help me to get
   this prioritized and dealt with promptly as possible. You are not
   getting the glory when my pride gets in the way. Please help me to
   set aside the pride, the sin that so easily ensnares, and look to
   you, Lord Jesus.
** [2009-07-23 Thu 10:31] It hasn't stopped, yet...
   Lord God, it hasn't stopped yet. And I know that you are judging me,
   right? I mean, bad things happen when you disobey, right? What else
   could it be? I mean, with me, there's always something I have
   screwed up or failed to do properly, or actively avoided doing (most
   of the time, that is the issue...)

   Is it really the case that I would rather die than have to make the
   effort to obey my Lord? "It's too hard, Lord; please kill me so that
   I won't have to make the effort to obey you..." Is that what I have
   said? That's pretty screwed up; it's not consistent with You, and
   who you are, right, Lord?
** [2009-07-23 Thu 10:54] No free pass (cherry-picking is idolatry)
   We're not given the luxury of picking which parts of God's character
   and person we are comfortable with, and which ones we're
   not. Cherry-picking out the attributes of God we find comforting, or
   preferable, and discarding the ones which make us uncomfortable, or
   disagreeable, is idolatry, isn't it? When we pick and choose which
   parts of God we like, we are engaging in idolatry, aren't we?
** [2009-07-27 Mon 16:10] I wonder
   I wonder if my dad has struggled with some of the same issues? I
   seem to recall...
** [2009-07-28 Tue 09:13] Some insights into my wife
   I was in "get my butt to work" mode this morning, which means that
   I was giving very succinct, curt, short answers and replies. This
   upset my wife. At first I didn't understand why she was upset: I
   was not trying to be ugly, my responses weren't delivered out of a
   heart and attitude that was angry or upset. I was just in a hurry.

   I think my wife's perception is that my spending time looking at
   emails in the morning was taking too much time away from her. It
   probably didn't help that I had the laptop up on the bed last night,
   listening to a speech by Michael Crichton. (It was a really good
   speech, too, in part about how the environmental movement just
   doesn't understand recent trends in the scientific understanding of
   the natural world, because most of the participants refuse to listen
   to, understand, recent results in areas like complexity theory...)

   First, she just doesn't like it when I use the computer in the
   evening, either. This is a bit of a problem, for there aren't too
   many other times when I get to use the computer at home.
   Nonetheless, the long-term perspective is valuable here: what
   matters in eternity?  Maybe short-changing this temporal life,
   world, for what is eternally significant is a reasonable, crucial
   trade-off.

   Second, she wants attention in the morning, when we're both awake,
   or she seems to. She wants me to rub her back and help her wake up
   as she drinks coffee. (There's a corresponding "bedtime ritual" as
   well, which which also involves a back rub, and she really needs me
   to be focused on her then as well.) So, when she said that I should
   just get up earlier, get dressed and everything first, then open up
   the laptop if there's time, she really meant that I should spend
   time with her first, and not open up the laptop at all, if it can
   be avoided. "The surest way to avoid that is to get to work much
   earlier," was her next step in the deduction.  She made it clear
   that my rushing about after closing down the laptop, and getting
   showered and dressed, just adds to her chaos quotient in the
   morning (or, this morning, at least.)

   Third, she seems to want our days and nights to be
   synchronized. This is not an explicit demand at all, but it is a
   demand: it is not subject to negotiation. Now that I have thought
   about this matter, it makes me doubt that I shall ever be allowed
   to do anything which violates that synchronization, such as leaving
   early to exercise, etc.  I have to wonder if it's because she feels
   neglected by me in other areas. Or perhaps this synchronization is
   a crucial part of what helps her to feel secure, loved, etc., in
   spite of all that language about trusting in God above all else. I
   need to get it through my thick male skull that this kind of thing
   may be part of how I am to be used of God to fulfill her need to
   feel secure, loved.
** [2009-07-28 Tue 15:24] Further thoughts about the spouse
   Hard to blame her for getting twitchy about computer use, right?
   What is she supposed to think, eh?
** [2009-07-29 Wed 11:19] We have dreadful code
   We have one of the biggest PL/SQL-based messes I have ever
   seen. That dataloader code is the most nauseatingly procedural mess
   I have ever seen somebody do. It's as if they didn't want to have to
   think declaratively at all. It's as if the authors of that mess were
   so accustomed to programming procedurally, and to retrieving data
   one record at a time, that they ended up using select statements as
   a substitute for the calls one would make to a keyed-file access
   library to retrieve a record (as one might in C or COBOL.)

   This mindset, coupled with the perennial American problem of
   refusing to write clear, declarative definitions of business
   concepts, would probably be fatal to a smaller company. The only
   reason we can get away with it here is because McKesson is big
   enough to absorb the high costs (which would be ruinous to a smaller
   company.)

   Lord God, I need your help to figure out how to navigate through
   this morass, this mess.
** [2009-08-07 Fri 09:02] I am angry-and-frustrated...
   Lord, I want the time to work on the doggone syntax-table and
   "pl/sql parsing and traversing in Emacs" problem, and I am not
   getting the time to do it!

   Oh, God: I am so frustrated with life right now. I am criticized for
   working on the computer at home, yet that is what will be necessary
   in order for me to "get it together" in the way we know we need
   to... Maybe this is just me throwing a pity party.

   I want to have the time to work on the things that I am curious
   about, irritated with, anxious to learn more about... But that's
   just rank, obnoxious, odious selfishness talking, isn't it? I live
   in a world in which very few of the people I actually work with,
   live with, actually care about abstractions, data structures,
   mathematics, etc. Even the people I work with at the office, who
   would benefit the most from such things.

   Why does my selfish heart keep coming up in this life you've so
   graciously granted to me and my family? What is my problem? Why do I
   feel so frustrated, defeated, squashed? Or am I simply "playing the
   victim" when I refer to myself that way? I am amazed at how often I
   come to you to "plead my case," as if you needed convincing before
   you will act in a way that I think would be good. That is
   extraordinarily self-centered, isn't it? Indeed, that kind of
   selfishness, self-centeredness is quite ordinary, common: this is a
   kind of sin of which all people are guilt.

   Please help me this day, Lord God, because once more, we're coming
   up on a weekend, in which I will be allowed very little time to be
   selfish, I guess. (I can't even talk to you about these things
   without being sarcastic, can I?)

   Here I am, just like my daughter: learning to submit to your will
   for my life. Is this a lesson I will be condemned to repeat until
   the day I die? The old, "poor sinning guy" just keeps coming back
   up, again and again. Why? If I am truly somebody who is redeemed,
   then why does this issue return to my attention?
** [2009-08-07 Fri 10:13] Why on a Friday?
   Why in the world do they finally get their heads dislodged from
   their rectums on a Friday? Now, they've got a test-run of that AR
   stuff going into that precious environment (the QA20 environment,
   right?) and they're going to be all friggin' excitable about the
   stuff they find (because they understand how it works even less than
   I do, and that's saying something!)

   I am really completely out of patience with the other people in my
   life today. Lord God, I need your help to get through the next
   couple of weeks.
** [2009-08-13 Thu 10:16] Dataloader is too procedural
   We're dealing with issues that are a direct consequence of the
   dataloader package being coded in a procedural manner. The authors
   of that thing couldn't bring themselves to the place where every
   operation was done declaratively. What do I mean by this? I mean
   that a loop was written where the use of a join query would have
   been much more cost-effective, from the code-maintenance and
   performance standpoint. And the procedural code I see is so poorly
   written that it is very difficult to follow and comprehend, and this
   means that the original authors were not even thinking clearly when
   they wrote imperative code. This adds insult to injury.

   This really has to be seen to be believed, and, as Arthur Laffer
   once said, "I've been to this barbecue so many times before, and
   it's just a matter of time before it blows up in your face." It is
   painfully obvious that McKesson management, or Per-Se management, or
   TechRx management, or whoever the heck it was, didn't give a rip
   about something that would perform well and be reliable and
   maintainable.
** [2009-08-18 Tue 08:56] I need to be humble
   I need your help, Lord God, to be humble today. I can't do that on
   my own effort and power. I am naturally an insufferably arrogant
   person who rubs others' noses in it when I am proven to be
   right. Lord God, please help me to remember what it is like to be
   pressured into working in a environment in which management is
   ignorant and just wants to "get something out there," and really
   doesn't give a rip about proper education, etc.
** [2009-08-19 Wed 09:02] Still Angry
   I'm still ticked off. And I got a very dismissive, disrespectful
   statement from my wife this morning, when we were talking about the
   "leadership thing" and getting the house sold, etc. If I had done
   something similar to her, directed from me to her, she would've
   glared at me and said, "that was uncalled for." I need to set the
   ground rules, make it clear that "sauce for the gander is also sauce
   for the goose." That's how I feel right now, anyway. It makes me
   pretty angry when this comes up, and she complains that she has to
   drag everybody else along with her. Yet this is something she needs
   to do, because she is the only one who can organize it, since she
   has the "gift of administration." This I have a rough time
   comprehending.

   And it's all mixed up with, tied in with, swirled around with, this
   toxic brew of my feelings, and my past fears, and money, etc. It
   cuts right to the heart of how I don't really trust God concerning
   money, and how I should deal with it, etc. I spent years being
   really irritated with Angelia because she refused to agree with me
   about things like: getting rid of complexity in financial
   arrangements (like credit cards, which show up in irresistable form,
   and which offer all kinds of "rewards programs" that are not what
   they claim to be, etc.), and living in a more modest house. So I
   guess I am really angry with her for refusing to submit to me,
   listen to me. And I did the wrong thing too: I simply did what I
   always do, withdraw and get really angry underneath. This is not
   leading. Yes, she did not submit, either. But I failed to lead.
** [2009-08-21 Fri 14:36] I don't know what to think anymore
   It seems that the world has gone mad, doesn't it? I don't know what
   to think anymore. And there's precious little sense of urgency on
   the part of many in the working world to understand things, is
   there? Either that, or it's just sheer exhaustion?

   I'm not making any sense, am I?
** [2009-08-24 Mon 09:27] Questions for AJ?
   1. If we bought the house for X, and financed X-D. We have made some
      payments on the mortgage before selling it, so now we owe
      X-D-P. Let's say we sell the house for X+K. Then the difference
      between what we sold the house for, and what we have left to pay,
      is: X+K - (X-D-P) == X+K - X + D + P == K + D + P, right? This
      means that we get back the amount of our original down payment,
      D, the amount of principal we paid into it before we sold it, P,
      and the increase in the house's price, K, correct? The equity we
      have in the house is D+P, correct? and we get to have the amount
      K, the increase in the house's selling price, correct?

      Wells Fargo would get paid the amount of (X-D-P), right?

      If we end up selling the house for some amount below X, at a
      "loss" of K, then it would work out like this:
       	X-K - X + D + P == D + P - K

      So, we are not "wiped out" so long as K < (D+P), but it also
      means that we have less to put down on the next house, right?

      What complicates this is the fact that we folded into the amount
      we financed an extra amount, due to fees, etc, so maybe it works
      out like this: financed was X-D+F ("F" for "fees"). Thus we would
      owe, at some later point, X-D-P+F, and then, if we sell it for
      X+K, we have X+K - (X-D-P+F) == X+K - X+D+P-F == K+D+P-F. This
      means that our equity is K+D+P-F, and if we sold the house for
      less than we paid for it, then K < 0.

      If K<0 and (D+P) + (K-F) < 0, then D+P < F-K, which means that
      the size of the loss is larger than the down payment D, the
      principal paid in before sale, P, minus the fees, F.

      Under what circumstances would we be paying to the bank, still?
      When the amount we sell it for is not enough to pay off the
      remaining balance of the amount financed, which would be
      X-D+F. Symbolically, this is situation would be:
       	X+K < X-D-P+F == K < -D -P + F == K-F < -D-P == D+P < F-K

      So, X-D-P+F - (X+K) == -D -P +F + K == K + F - D - P.

      Hopefully, K+F is smaller than D+P, which would mean that the
      down payment and principal-paid-in were large enough to "absorb
      the loss?"

      If we sell it for less than X, and yet we don't owe the bank,
      this would mean that:
       	K<0 and yet X-D-P+F < X+K == -D-P+F < K == F-K < D+P

      So, what is the amount "lost" in this situation? Well, we sold
      for less than what we paid, right? And we had X-D-P+F left to
      pay, right? So, X+K is what we sold it for, and K<0, and:

      If X+K <= X-D-P+F, which means that the loss was big enough that
      we've either "broken even" or the loss was large enough that we
      still owe the mortgage company after the sale, right? This means
      that the size of the loss (plus the size of those fees) was big
      enough to "consume" the original down payment plus the bit of
      principal that had been paid towards the loan right before the
      sale of the house. The relationship between D+P and everything
      else looks like this:
       	X+K <= X-D-P+F == K <= F-D-P == D+P <= F-K.
      So, I would think that (F-K)-(D+P) is what you would have to pay
      off with the mortgage company, still. 

      If X-D-P+F < X+K, this means that:
       	-D-P+F < K == F-K < D+P
      which tells me that the loss was smaller than the amount of the
      down payment, plus the principal that we had paid right before
      the sale of the house.

   2. I need to understand what we originally paid, plus what we think
      we could sell it for, to determine what I think we would "make"
      from the deal?
** [2009-08-25 Tue 12:44] Oh, I don't deserve...
   ... my precious wife and children.
   God's gracious grant of a mathematically trained mind.
   God's grace, period.
   God's provision of every breath.

   How can I continue to live in this way, when the entirety of the
   surrounding culture is slowly going mad, slowly being swallowed up
   by "so mocking a fantasy," which does "obsess the mind of mortal
   man."

   Yes, indeed: "Never did so mocking a fantasy obsess the mind of
   mortal man," Churchill said.

   Oh, my Lord and my God. I feel daunted, and yet at the same time you
   are in control, and you have called me to stand and fight, fight for
   your cause, in the manner and way in which you have called me to
   fight, even if it will cost me my life. In fact, you promised that
   it does, and will, require my life of me! Help me to be like those
   who have gone before me, to stand and fight for what is right, just
   as you showed us how, Lord Jesus.
** [2009-08-25 Tue 12:56] Why don't the other men understand?
   Why don't the other men I have met with understand that we are
   indeed a nation of redeemed people who are indeed embroiled in a
   war, a war for the hearts and souls of every man, woman, and child
   in the human race?

   This question did not occur to me until recently, yet at the back of
   it are statements I have heard men make: statements like "Well, he's
   an evangelist, but he's not a pastor," and "He's working like a
   general in charge of soldiers, and dispatching people instead of
   caring for them, etc." I can't honestly say that the latter was a
   verbatim quotation, but the former definitely is.

   Why do we let this world corrupt our senses, and dull us to the
   reality unfolding around us every day? We are indeed a people at
   war, called to resist the occupying forces until D-Day arrives, and
   this war is brought to conclusion. Listen, the turning of the tide
   of this war took place 2,000 years ago at a place of execution
   outside Jerusalem.

   Why did it take me so long to see and understand this? God help me
   to always remember that "all will be made right," and that "out of
   the depths of sorrow and sacrifice will be born again" the glory
   that you had intended for all creation before the Fall so
   desperately and completely corrupted it all, at the start of this
   war.
** [2009-08-27 Thu 10:44] something about the release meeting this morning :work-related:
   Lotsa issues related to AR changes, stated by Kathleen McMillan?
   2.2.0.b0 goes live at Dierbergs next week (Tues AM?)
   HealthParters gets it live on [2009-09-14 Mon]?
   Apparently, there were all kinds of BIG AR-related problems, hence the hurry
   to repair problems as of this release, right?

** [2009-08-28 Fri 13:55] The things I MUST remember
   + God is above all, and Lord of all things, all people, all
     governments, all situations. He is ultimately, finally, in
     control.
   + God is at work all around me.
   + God invites me to participate in what he is doing.
   + This invitation leads to a crisis of belief that demands,
     requires, faith and action.

   Oh, Mighty keeper of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
   Savior who takes away the sins of the earth: forgive me for failing
   to trust in you completely and totally without reservations. Help me
   to trust in you, in spite of my fears and help me to always remember
   that you are the triumphant, eternal one who will return, D-day
   style, one day, to make all come right. Lift up my heart, for I
   can't do it myself. Thank you for your truth, your holy honesty and
   your holy reality. You are great and greatly to be praised.
** [2009-09-02 Wed 08:58] Tired and Angry
   Lord God, please forgive me. I am so tired, angry, impatient. And I
   am thinking only about myself this morning, which absolutely must
   stop. Please help me to think about the needs and best interests of
   others, especially those of my wife and children. And I don't act,
   do, consistently with my belief system, so my belief system is
   worthless, isn't it?

   I confess that I was getting very impatient last night. I am upset
   and irritated because I only have a few hours after work each night,
   and it seems to be such a titanic struggle to get everything done,
   to get the girls to focus on the work at hand, to get it done and
   ready for the next steps, etc. Plus, there is absolutely no time
   left to do the other administrative things I feel pressured to
   do. And I have just "made a little correction" to things in order to
   get home sooner, and that really chafes me right now because it
   strikes at the kind of thing I hold dear as a prideful man: my
   workplace "prowess," how competent I appear to be at the
   workplace. Whoa, there, that really is at the heart of things, isn't
   it? I am prideful about my workplace, and that is the place I
   retreat to when other parts of life get really difficult,
   challenging, hard, whatever. This throws everything else out of
   balance, doesn't it?
** [2009-09-14 Mon 15:47] Oh man!
   Lord God help me! I am so angry! It really ticks me off when she
   says things like that (like, "Oh, let me call Delta tomorrow and see
   if they can do better, blah-blah-blah...") and then she doesn't follow
   through!

   I guess this level of anger and irritation is out of proportion with
   the size of the issue.

   God help me. I am such a manipulative jerk. I am looking for stuff
   to blame on her so that I don't look so bad, instead of being the
   leader in our household. I don't like this part of being the father
   and husband, but it's my job nonetheless. Maybe this is one of those
   areas in which I have to be supernaturally dependent on You in order
   to get through this part of life, because I have no desire to do
   it... Why don't I want to do what is right for my wife and family?
   Why can't I consistently get on the ball about that?

   Please help me, Lord Jesus.
** [2009-10-09 Fri 09:46] Where does stuff-with-family fit in?
   Arguably, doing stuff with your family, for its own sake, might be
   contrary to God's design for your life. It seems to be possible to
   make a case for this. So, this might be part of why our friends
   don't seem to get all that worked up over their families, spending
   lots of time with their parents all the time?
** [2009-11-04 Wed 09:00] Concerned about allergies-mappings situation
   I'm concerned that I have not shown enough leadership here; it may not
   result in a good rating for me? I need to make sure that I am not being
   too paranoid.

   I don't know what to think here, and I am also feeling
   harried/pinched from many sides, but much of that is my own darn
   fault, is it not? Hearkens back to the notion that sometimes this
   hard stuff really is my fault, a consequence of my own personal
   failure to follow hard after God, to obey him: it's a consequence of
   my own disobedience, stubbornness, lack of trust in God, etc.

   Which takes me back to frustration-ville: paradoxically, I think,
   Christianity is a *tremendous lot of hard work.* I don't see how in
   the world we are supposed to get around that. So I therefore don't
   have a great deal of patience with all this soft soap about how God
   is a God-of-grace, and it'll all be okay. It seems that the whole
   truth about the matter *must* include following ideas:

   + It absolutely will *not* turn out okay unless *I* work *very hard*
     at those things he has set out for me to do.
   + Unless I work very hard to make those things happen, then it will
     not somehow magically work out to be okay. It just won't.
   + And all that soft soap, all those *lies* about the nature of
     grace, just don't help me a bit.
   + I have to work hard to make it happen, and nobody on this earth is
     of any help to me. Maybe God himself is (although I frankly
     confess that I don't really get that) but a lot of the time, I
     really have to strain to see that.
   + The 'God-helping-me' part is hard for me to see when I am in the
     thick of it, that is for sure.
** [2009-11-17 Tue 09:18] Oh, Lord God
   Why do we who are supposed to be yours struggling with sin so much?
   If we are truly your people, then why do we still sin? Why is it
   such a difficulty for people, even people who have tasted your glory
   and majesty, to follow you completely?
** [2010-01-21 Thu 08:35] Help
   Lord God, please help me to be patient; I so badly want to just rewrite
   so much of the dataloader code, because it is so awful. How could anybody
   think that it was structured well, or that its hideously procedural
   approach was the right way to do things?  I am really struggling every
   time I look at it, but I also know that it's just not enough to complain.
   I must have a sensible plan to improve it, or it will never happen.

   How can I derive such a plan?  Is that even your will for me?
** [2010-01-21 Thu 09:54] Oh! AR stuff!
   Having to look back through silliness in the AR-accounts processing code which
   really grates at me; KR (pig-headedly) insisted that I write joins using that
   execrable, and semantically questionable, ANSI syntax.  Ugh.  Now I am trying
   to follow that mess, understand it all over again, a full bloody year after
   the code was written.  If I had been forced to write all of it completely
   procedurally, the code would have been four times longer and eight times harder
   to re-acquaint myself with a full wretched year later!
** [2010-02-08 Mon 15:15] Subversion understandings
   Okay, I am starting to "get it" more nowadays: it took my setting up
   a little local, filesystem-based subversion repository on my local
   box to see for myself, but I know understand more of this stuff
   about branching, merging, and "cherry-picking" individual changes to
   be applied to a particular file in a "branch."

   The point seems to be that you have to make a copy of an existing
   directory hierarchy, and make sure to specify a particular
   repository version number as the starting place for that copy.  In
   subversion-land, a "branch" is just an arbitrary copy of the
   directory hierarchy, perhaps derived from what was rooted at "trunk"
   in the hierarchy.  Then, it is possible to derive changes from the
   doggone trunk to be individually applied to their counterparts in
   that particular descendant of the "branch" root.  This is done by
   "merging" together the state of the file in the trunk, as of a
   particular revision number, and the file in the branch.

   I think what is happinging is that Subversion uses something akin to
   diff to derive a "change"; what is not at all clear to me is now
   context is determined/specified/calculated by "diff," but obviously
   it is!
** [2010-02-16 Tue 08:37] HAH!  Foreign Key Index issues continue...
   Hah!  I'm seeing FK index issues continue to bit them on the fanny.
   And folk are clamoring for the stuff I helped build last July,
   right?  What a bad joke.  The (pig-headed) refusal to permit the
   creation, use of indices on the foreign key columns continues to
   cause conversion problems!  Maybe you really can leave them out of
   the system whilst doing your day-to-day stuff, but their absence is
   devastating to the performance of conversion opeartions!

   There were two alleged objections I heard:
   1. The FK indexes cost too much to maintain (i.e., there is an
      unacceptable performance penalty that comes when insert, update,
      or delete is performed against the table which has the FK index.)
   2. The FK indexes cause the CBO to pick bad execution plans for the
      day-to-day operations of the application.

   I can't say much to point 1, except that we can't afford *NOT* to
   have the FK indexes in place, and if you design the application
   properly, index maintenance does not have to be unacceptably
   expensive.

   Apparently, there is a ham-handed answer to point 2, in the form of
   making the indexes invisible to certain users through a special
   session-level setting/parameter that has been added to Oracle as of
   version 10.  The answer which is much less ham-handed is that you
   don't get excused from forcing your programmers to learn to use the
   database properly: removing the FK index structures from the system
   is a dodge, a shabby excuse, a smoke screen that has been thrown up
   to cover over the fact that the programmers who have worked on this
   stuff were not properly trained in how to get things to perform
   acceptably in Oracle, and how to use tools like "explain plan," and
   how to read an execution plan.  They have been allowed to get away
   with treating the database system as a "magic black box," and that
   is a losing strategy which just causes problems later.  There is not
   "royal road" to proficiency with Oracle (or any other relational
   database system, for that matter) but I have the impression that
   many who worked on EnterpriseRx though they found one!
** [2010-02-16 Tue 13:28] Kyrie Eleison!
   Have mercy on me, Lord God, please...
   I have placed more trust in a bank account balance than in you,
   Lord God.  Please forgive me, that is a sin.

   And I have allowed over-worry to dominate my heart and mind, which
   is wrong, too.  Even though I know I can trust in you, I don't
   live consistent with such a claim, do I?
** [2010-02-22 Mon 15:08] You are remarkable, God.
   Lord God, you allow us to live and breathe.  And yes, what is fair
   and right for us is hell, instead of life in this world, and then
   heaven, being with with you, in your presence, in the world to come.
   This is astonishing.
** [2010-02-22 Mon 15:10] Amazement
   Mighty, holy God.  I need your help to get my act together.  I need to
   be able to understand this other stuff, this Zope/Plone stuff, and the
   way to maintain internet service without having to keep the U-verse stuff,
   either.

   I don't have lots of patience for the present situation, or for my coworkers.
   I don't have lots of patience for the present McKesson attitude towards
   declarative programming.  But I also know that, even if they did care about
   such things, there would be something else broken and fundamentally flawed
   in the situation, that would be absolutely mournful.  This is because of the
   fundamental sinfulness of human beings and human institutions.  And the only
   one who can fix that problem is God himself.
** [2010-02-22 Mon 15:52] Frustration
   The frustrating thing about the implementation route they (McKesson)
   chose is that the declarative approach is not just more elegant, it
   also dramatically more efficient.  But their refusal to see that is
   killing us, and our implementation of more procedural stuff probably
   degrades performance even further!  I suspect that the
   procedures-nested- inside-procedures, procedures-invoking-procedures
   approach we have taken has served only to obfuscate, hide,
   performance problems.

   The other thing is that this infrastructure makes testing of ANYTHING
   incredibly, unnecessarily, difficult.

   I should factor out those pieces which are directly dependent on
   dataloader infrastructure, like the doggone
   functions-to-derive-sequence-values, and other pieces as well, and
   put those into a layer which can be replaced with "test-harness
   versions..."  This would permite me to move much faster, right?
** [2010-03-11 Thu 09:12] I DON'T UNDERSTAND
   I fail to understand the obsession with schedules.
   Better yet, this is the way to talk about it: The danger of
   management to a schedule is that people become so focused on meeting
   deadlines that quality suffers.  This happens because of the
   mis-directed focus on software testing, in my opinion.  And it
   happens because of over-optimistic scheduling in the first place,
   which means that the testing which is worthwhile becomes
   overburdened with trying to test things which should have been
   unit-tested in the first place.

   I say these things because I am being presently pressured to commit
   code by tomorrow which has not been adequately tested in isolation
   yet.  This is because it took me a very long time to work out the
   changes needed, and to make the code changes in a text editor, and
   to do a review of printed copies of the code so that I can avoid
   putting in changes which won't even pass muster with the PL/SQL
   compiler...
** [2010-04-05 Mon 09:13] I am a rebellious man...
   Please, help me, Lord God.  Some say, "The heart wants what the
   heart wants," and I guess that is true about me, isn't it?  I am the
   most rebellious person I can think of, and I bristle when anybody
   tries to make suggestions to me or override what I think to be good
   judgement, especially when it has to do with "me and my stuff,"
   e.g., things I think I know something about, etc.  And it's just my
   fleshly pride, isn't it?

   Why does it all come crashing in, sometimes?  Why does it all come
   crashing in on me, or I feel like it is?  I am again at a point of
   faith-crisis, right?  Oh, God, I pray for JT, for the Brown family.
   Oh, Jesus, why do we make ourselves so miserable.  And I am miserable
   because I have to take responsibility for things that I did not really
   want responsibility for.  Perhaps this is because You wanted these
   things to be in my life because You want me to grow in the wisdom
   and knowledge of You, so that You can get the glory, because I don't
   have it in me to do these things.  This is what I preach to my children,
   but it sounds like I don't believe it myself.  Please help me to live
   this out in my life, so that You are glorified, so that I can give You
   the glory, Lord God, Father Almighty, and Ancient of Days, Holy Son
   of God.

   Oh, Holy Spirit, thank you for your peace-that-passes-all-understanding.
** [2010-04-12 Mon 09:45] Testimony #1
   {Just some thoughts that I shall have to work much harder at in
   order to come up with a concise, easily understood testimony which
   can be shared inside of two minutes.}
   
   We all need Jesus Christ to redeem us.  The world won't change,
   really change for the better, until all people are redeemed.
   Problem is, this is a decision each person must personally make, and
   it costs each of us everything.

   I am discovering this: I can't live the way I thought I wanted to,
   and be a follower of Jesus Christ.  Yet Jesus promises joy and
   satisfaction in following after Him.  This is one of those things
   about being a disciple that seems so paradoxical.

   I thought that Jesus was just supposed to straighten a few of those
   nagging problems out, like swearing, inappropriate thoughts.  But it
   goes much deeper than that, and it seems to require a kind of effort
   on my part: some of that effort involves straining, working, to hear
   and understand Him (through reading his Word, prayer, and
   interaction with others in a community of Christ-followers, which is
   called the Body of Christ, or the Church.)  

   I thought that I was supposed to be "saved" and then go and work
   really hard to make sure that I do a good job in the workplace.  But
   I was really just medicating myself by working really hard, and this
   obsession with work and learning new technologies has had a huge,
   adverse impact on me, my family, and my relationship with Jesus
   Christ.  I fear this obsession has actually made me less available
   to be used in the body of Christ, I fear.
** [2010-04-12 Mon 10:55] Testimony #2
   Abraham Kuyper once said, "There is not a single part of human life
   that Jesus Christ does not look at and exclaim, 'That's mine!'"
   (I may be paraphrasing, but that is the gist of it...)

   There are spheres of human existence which are separate, but should
   be considered "equal" before the face of God, "coram Deo."  So,
   *everything* belongs to Jesus, even my job, my money, the house,
   my wife, my children...
** Mon Apr 19 13:58:25 2010 ([2010-04-19 Mon 13:50] What Victor Davis Hanson once said:)
   [2010-04-19 Mon 13:50] What Victor Davis Hanson once said:
   Liberalism has become a boutique plaything for the very wealthy to help the
   very poor.  They get a psychological benefit out of it, and they despise
   the real estate agent, the family orthodontist, the hardware store owner
   who wants to be rich and doesn't send his kid to the Ivy League and
   doesn't have the accoutrements of culture.  Those people they absolutely
   hate.  When I see these guys... I go up to the lake once in a while, and
   some guy, as I said last time, comes in with a big truck and a jet ski,
   and I told him, "I can see a bull's eye on your back with Obama written
   all over it, from a mile away."  They despise such people:  everything about
   them.  They're energy-consuming, entrepreneurial, and crass, and these guys
   are going to get killed.  These're the guys who're crawling into a hole
   right now and not hiring anybody, and we're wondering why we don't have
   job growth!
   
** [2010-05-07 Fri 11:33] What is Your Plan, Lord God?
   I know that you have written the end of the story, LORD God.  I guess
   that it's my own faithless-ness which I shall have to combat for the
   rest of my life.  Plus the fact that I am appallingly lazy, and have
   refused to do the right things because it means working hard on things
   I find distasteful.

   I have spent so much time ruminating over the notion of "God redeeming
   work," and puzzling over issues like "work and faith," etc.  But the
   flip side of it is that nothing, nothing at all, which you have called
   me to do, is unimportant or "beneath me."  Really, I sought in the whole
   "God redeeming all work" talk a justification for my desire to work in
   computing.  "Work in software, programming a computer, can be something
   God calls a person to do, also!" was my cry.  And I thought that, because
   I have some talent for it, and get something of a rush from it, that
   it just had to be something you wanted me to spend my life doing.
   What a waste.  Oh, my God.  You have not forsaken me, ever, but I have
   forsaken you repeatedly, haven't I?

   Oh, my God.  Such idolatry in my heart, lived out in my life.  The
   shame and regret over the wasting of what you granted to me is more
   than I can bear.  And even this kind of sorrow, is it at all "Godly
   sorrow that leads to repentance?"  I can't even be contrite in a
   righteous manner, can I, LORD?  I am utterly bankrupt and destroyed
   before you.  Maybe that is the purpose of money, isn't it?  To
   highlight my dependence on You for everything.
* MARKERS
** [2009-06-15 Mon 12:34] God Provided the BellSouth job
   God provided me with a job at BellSouth, at the end of 1998. I despaired
   of ever working being able to work a different job than the job I had been
   working for the family business. I thought I had condemned myself to that,
   but God provided a new opportunity.

   So, what made the new job possible, my own attractiveness, or God's provision?
   Is it really my inherent skill and talent that gets me the job? Is it something
   that I have done which gets the the job? No, God provides it all: who is the
   source of the abilities and skills which induce someone to hire me in the first
   place?
** [2009-06-15 Mon 12:37] God Provided the McKesson Job
   When, towards the end of 2008, I was SO tired of working at AT&T (which is
   what BellSouth had turned into) I got a call "out of the blue" from a
   recruiter. And I had seen the job posting before, for McKesson, too!

   I don't pretend to have been doing what I should have been doing at that
   moment in time: I was even less in tune with God and his direction for me,
   at that time, than I am now. But I did know, then, and now, that God provided
   the job for me, because they came back with another offer, even after I
   initially turned them down. So, God allowed it at the least, and it is more
   the kind of work I think takes advantage of what I am good at.
** [2009-06-15 Mon 14:22] God Provided my Wife
   I don't understand how it is that I have such a wonderful woman for
   my wife. I certainly don't deserve her, and she is a clear sign of
   God's provision for me. Neither of us is anything close to perfect;
   we are both sinners in need of God's grace and sustenance in order
   to continue existing! But I know that Angelia's existence in my life
   is a clear indication of God's hand in the events of my life.
** [2009-06-15 Mon 14:25] Parents Who Tried
   My parents tried, as best as they knew how, to honor God in the way
   they raised me and my brothers. They were dealt a big blow with
   Rob's situation. And I don't understand why that had to happen. It
   may not make sense until long after we've all left for the other
   side. But my folks tried, and they still pray for us, I know.

   It's complicated (to me, anyway) and I haven't always done the right
   things in my relationship with them, but I know that they have
   tried, as best as they could, to do the right thing, to honor God
   in how they raised us, and it is because of them, the evangelical
   heritage they came out of, that I am where I am today. I could have
   been born into a very different, much rougher, much worse family
   situation, but I was not, so this is a sign of God's hand in my
   life's events.
** [2009-06-15 Mon 14:48] God Provided Money for Missions Trips
   God has always provided enough money for the missions trips we have
   taken: he provided a substantial retention bonus (from BellSouth,
   during the transition year as the merger with AT&T was finalized)
   and he has always provided for us.
** [2009-06-15 Mon 15:25] Could This be a Marker?
   Did God grant me an affinity for the technical, logical,
   mathematical for a reason? What could that reason possibly be? Is it
   for apologetics purposes? What is the point? Or is this me just
   using a talent (which should actually be directed elsewhere) to make
   myself happy, enrich myself? Lord, I need to understand.
